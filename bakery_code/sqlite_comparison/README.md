## SQLite Prototype and Comparison

This folder contains the original unnormalized SQLite schema and related
queries used during early development and exploratory analysis.

These queries were later executed against a normalized PostgreSQL
database to compare performance, maintainability, and schema design
tradeoffs.

SQLite database files and DB Browser project files are intentionally
excluded in favor of version-controlled SQL source.
